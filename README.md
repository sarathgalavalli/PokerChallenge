# PokerChallenge

A poker hand consists of a combination of five playing cards, ranked in the following ascending order (lowest to highest):

Description
1-High card
2-Pair
3-Two pairs
4-Three of a kind
5-Straight All five cards in consecutive value order
6-Flush
7-Full house
8-Four of a kind
9-Straight flush
10-Royal Flush
Ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace in the same suit
The cards are valued in the order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace*
* For this exercise, Ace is considered high only. (i.e. cannot be used as a low card below 2 in a straight).
Suits are: Diamonds (D), Hearts (H), Spades (S), Clubs (C)
When multiple players have the same ranked hand then the rank made up of the highest value cards wins. For example, pair of kings beats a pair of queens, and a straight with a high card of Jack beats a straight with high card of nine.
If two ranks tie, for example, if both players have a pair of Jacks, then highest cards in each hand are compared; if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

Note - suits are not taken into account to break a tie for this exercise - only the value of the card determines a winner. Thus as a result when we have test data "considering that FLUSH has always different cards"
